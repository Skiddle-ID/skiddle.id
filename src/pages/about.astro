      I'm have a little ADHD, but I'm lucky enough to not have

    <h2>My interests</h2>

    <p>
      I'm a open to learning anything new. It doesnâ€™t matter if it's not tech, I
      just want to learn. From history to philosophy, from music to art, from
      sports to games, I'm always up for a new challenge.
    </p>

    <p>
      Primarily last few years, I've been interested in building with AI, 
      and I've been learning a lot about it. This related to my major in 
      Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of programming, I enjoy gaming, and also learning about aviation.
      I've been learning to fly for a while now, and I'm also interested in 
      learning about space. Also working towards a PPL license (Private Pilot License).
    </p>

    <p>
      As a {age}-year-old, I Feel missing out on a lot of the social aspect of 
      the world, but I try to make the most of it.
